# Biodiversity data - Codecademy Portfolio Project

### Learning goals

This is a practice project from **Codecademy Data Science and Machine Learning** path.

The learning goal of this project is to practice data analysis and visualization.
In particular I have been practicing data enginerring (data cleaning and adaptation) and presentation principles.

The data for the project have been provided by the institution, and are in part artificially produced.
I try to find interesting patterns in them.

### Project mission

For this project, you will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

You will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

After you perform your analysis, you will share your findings about the National Park Service.

### The data

The data consist of two datasets in CSV files:

* **species_info.csv** - contains data about different species and their conservation status
* **observations.csv** - holds recorded sightings of different species at several national parks for the past 7 days.

### Languages

The data investigation is taken place in a Python notebook **biodiversity.ipynb**

### Presentation

A slides presentation was also produced from the notebook. It is at [Biodiversity_Presentation.pptx](/Biodiversity_Presentation.pptx)
